Read more about the project [here](http://urbanhonking.com/ideasfordozens/2013/10/04/case-and-molly-a-game-inspired-by-neuromancer/). This repo is available in case the code (which encompasses some tools for doing stereographs with the Oculus Rift in Unity, and communicating between Unity, Node, and the browser with websockets) might be useful to someone.

This is not as a commercial project. Please do not use it to violate William Gibson's IP.
